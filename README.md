# Windfall Clause

The [Windfall Clause](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/windfallclause/) is a proposed corporate pledge that obliges signers to donate excessive profits (in proportion of Gross World Product) from AI transformation they may own. 

[WhalerDAO](https://whalerdao.org/) has noted the [near-term potential for similar transformations](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/request-for-comments-use-defi-to-save-the-world/3830) of the trillion++ financial industry through DeFi protocols. DeFi governors, as represented by DAOs and related tokens, stand in a moment of power and can hedge against evil outcomes, however remote, through signing an adapted form of Windfall Clause enforced through Ethereum smart contracts.

## Drafting Considerations

| Desideratum | Description | Justification | 
|----------|:-------------:| :-------------:|
| ***Transparency*** | Determining whether a signatory has met their obligations is easy | *Avoids costly disputes and public relations benefits* |
| ***Elasticity*** | The amount owed under the Clause depends on the size of the global economy when triggered | *Maintains focus on relative windfall, not nominal profits* |
| ***Adequacy*** | The amount owed under the Clause is proportionate to the challenges it seeks to address | *Respects the seriousness of the policy motivations for the Clause* |
| ***Nominal Near-Windfall Commitment*** | Signatories owe small-but-nonzero amounts as they approach windfall profit levels | *Demonstrates signatories’ intent to be bound; tests effectiveness of Clause* |
| ***Incentive Alignment*** | Signatories should always have an incentive to earn more profits | *Diminishes incentives for evading Clause obligations* |
| ***Competitiveness*** | Signatories remain competitive with non-signatory developers | *Prevents perverse effect of causing non-signatories to out-compete signatories* |
